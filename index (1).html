    <h2>My City</h2>
    <p>
      I live in Johannesburg,South Africa, by the way it is the biggest city in South Africa. Johannesburg is commonly called "Jozi" by the locals and other street names like "Joburg" as well as "Egoli" meaning City of Gold. It started as gold mining settlement in the 19th century.
 Vilakazi street in a township named Soweto put Johannesburg on the world map having being the only street in the world who was once home to Two Noble Prize Laureate winners namely; Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu and Nelson Mandela.
      Some of the Fun things to do in my city is to visit Aparthied Museum, Soweto, Gold Reef City, Sci-Bono Discovery Centre among other major landmarks. Sadly no beaches in Johannesburg.
